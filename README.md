# Todo Admin App

This project might serve as a sample application for demonstrating the following functionality and tools:

- React + Redux with separation of code into modules.
- Selectors and Reselect.
- Redux Thunk and async requests with error handling.
- Semantic UI design and components.
- Using React Router.
- Form validation.
- Simple Express-based REST API.
- Interaction with PostgreSQL and SQL queries.
- Session authentication and password encryption.
- Environment variables.
- Deployment to Heroku (including static file rendering).

Demoing "from scratch" can take up to six 1.5-hour sessions. Approximate breakdown by session:

1. Running an express-based server, connecting to PostgreSQL. Creating a few initial endpoints.
1. Adding simple routing. Implementing functionality for showing, creating, and removing users.
1. Implementing functionality for editing users, showing and creating todo items.
1. Implementing authentication on the backend side.
1. Implementing authentication on the frontend side.
1. Deploying to Heroku.

In order to expedite the process, you can choose to simplify some parts or use the existing code instead of building the project from the ground up.

Note that this app is also a subject of testing performed during the [Selenium QA lesson](https://github.com/mate-academy/fe-program/tree/master/qa/end-to-end/_instructions.md).
